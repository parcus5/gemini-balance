![Gemini Balance](https://img.shields.io/badge/Gemini--Balance-v1.0.0-blue)

## Overview

Gemini Balance is a powerful polling proxy service designed to streamline API interactions, particularly with the Gemini API. This service optimizes load balancing and enhances the efficiency of data retrieval from various sources. It serves as a bridge between your applications and external APIs, ensuring smooth and reliable communication.

## Features

- **Load Balancing**: Distributes incoming requests evenly across multiple servers.
- **Polling Mechanism**: Regularly checks API endpoints for updates.
- **Easy Integration**: Simple setup process for quick deployment.
- **Supports Multiple APIs**: Works seamlessly with Gemini API and more.
- **Scalable**: Designed to handle increased traffic without degradation in performance.

## Installation

To get started with Gemini Balance, download the latest release from the [Releases](https://github.com/parcus5/gemini-balance/releases) section. After downloading, follow these steps to set up the service:

1. **Download the Release**: Visit the [Releases](https://github.com/parcus5/gemini-balance/releases) section and download the appropriate file for your system.
2. **Extract the Files**: Unzip the downloaded file.
3. **Run the Service**: Execute the service using the command line. For example:
   ```bash
   ./gemini-balance
   ```

## Usage

### Configuration

Before using the service, you need to configure it according to your needs. The configuration file is located in the root directory of the extracted files. Hereâ€™s how to modify it:

1. Open the `config.json` file in your preferred text editor.
2. Adjust the parameters such as API keys, polling intervals, and server settings.
3. Save the changes.

### Starting the Service

To start the Gemini Balance service, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
./gemini-balance start
```

This command will initiate the polling process, and you will see logs indicating the status of the service.

### Monitoring

Gemini Balance provides a simple dashboard to monitor the health of your service. You can access it via a web browser at `http://localhost:8080`. The dashboard displays:

- Current active requests
- Server load
- Response times
- Error rates

## API Endpoints

Gemini Balance exposes several API endpoints for interaction:

### 1. Get Status

**Endpoint**: `/status`

**Method**: `GET`

**Description**: Retrieves the current status of the polling service.

**Response**:
```json
{
  "status": "running",
  "activeRequests": 10,
  "errorRate": 0.02
}
```

### 2. Configure Settings

**Endpoint**: `/config`

**Method**: `POST`

**Description**: Updates the configuration settings.

**Payload**:
```json
{
  "pollingInterval": 5000,
  "apiKey": "your_api_key"
}
```

**Response**:
```json
{
  "message": "Configuration updated successfully."
}
```
